## Preparing the micro SD

- Start by formatting your micro SD card. Select FAT32 for the file system and 4096 bytes sector size (these parameters are strictly required for the procedure to work
- Copy the DWIN_SET folder from the archive you previously downloaded to the root of your micro SD card.
- Unmount and unplug your micro SD card.

## Flashing the touchscreen

- Turn off and unplug your printer (both power and USB).
- You will need to access the micro SD slot on the back of the touchscreen (not the one that could be on your mainboard). If necessary, open the printer to be able to access this slot.
- Insert the micro SD card into the slot.
- Plug the printer's power cable back (and only the power cable) and turn the printer on.
- After a few second, the screen's background will turn blue and the flashing procedure will begin.
- **Do not cut power to the printer while the flashing procedure is running!**
* When the procedure ends, you will be back on the page with a blue background. There will be an END message at the top and you'll be presented with a summary of what was flashed.
